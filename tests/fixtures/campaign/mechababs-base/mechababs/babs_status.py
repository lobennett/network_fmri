"""Read and decide from ``babs status --json`` — the reconciler's decision seam.

Small and pure so the decision is unit-testable and the one spot that knows the
``babs status --json`` shape is isolated. We use only
``total``/``submitted``/``done``/``failed`` and ignore the live-state buckets
(pending/running/completing/configuring): those are a raw scheduler snapshot that
can transiently overlap ``done``, so in-progress is derived as
``submitted - done - failed`` rather than summed.
