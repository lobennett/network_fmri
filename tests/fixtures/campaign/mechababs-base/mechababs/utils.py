"""utils.py — the campaign's datalad primitives: `locked` and `datalad_save_scope`.

The two things every campaign mutator (`add-dataset`, `iterate`,
`retire-derivative`) needs: a single-writer lock, and a way to collapse a block of
work into one labeled provenance node. They are kept together because they are
always used together — take the lock, then open a scope.

`datalad_save_scope` is a clean-in / one-node-out context manager built entirely
on `ds.save(since=<entry>)` (datalad#7821's run-merge engine, exposed via `since=`).
It records HEAD at entry and, on clean exit, collapses everything the block did
into ONE first-parent commit — one labeled "node" — on `ds`'s mainline:

  - a block that only edited files              -> a flat commit;
  - a block that made inner commits (babs init) -> a merge whose FIRST parent is
                                                   the entry sha and whose second
                                                   parent is the inner chain, so
                                                   `git log --first-parent` shows
                                                   just this one labeled step (the
                                                   inner commits stay reachable +
                                                   `datalad rerun`-able off it).

"One node" is PER touched dataset, not one commit total. `recursive=True` is the
load-bearing correctness knob: without it a subdataset-deep change (the derivative's
own commits under a study under the campaign) is a silent `notneeded` no-op, so the
campaign never records the advance. With it, one call bumps a gitlink up each level
of the nest — one clean node at the derivative, one at the study, one at the campaign
(the irreducible per-level ripple: git can't move the super's pointer without the
sub having a new commit to point at).

The clean-in guard makes "everything since base == this block's work" true, so the
node is attributable; a dirty tree raises rather than absorbing unrelated changes.
