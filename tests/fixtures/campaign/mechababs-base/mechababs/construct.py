"""construct.py — the body of ``mechababs configure`` (campaign construction).

Runs from inside the campaign venv (invoked by ``cli.cmd_configure`` after
``bootstrap.sh`` built the environment: the datalad dataset, the vendored
babs/mechababs code pins, and the venv). It reads the vendored pipeline +
cluster configs, vendors each pipeline's container into ``code/<dir>``, and
writes the mechababs config + the mechababs state-file ledger.

Re-runnable: container vendoring skips a ``code/<dir>`` already present, so a
reset (delete the ledger, re-run ``configure``) reuses the vendored containers.
The ledger guard lives in ``cli`` (refuses if the ledger exists, so
``add-dataset`` rows are never clobbered).
