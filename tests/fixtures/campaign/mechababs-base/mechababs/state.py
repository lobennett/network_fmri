"""state.py — the campaign's desc-mechababs_datasets.tsv ledger accessor.

A wide TSV: dataset/identity columns (``dataset_id``, ``study_url``,
``processing_level``, ``n_subjects``, ``n_sessions``) then a column-group per pipeline
(``<p>_babs``/``_babs-merged``). There is no status enum — a pipeline's state is
derived from which columns are populated (``babs`` -> the babs-project path, set
once scaffolded; ``babs-merged`` -> finished). The per-pipeline
inclusion size is not stored here — it lives in the pinned inclusion.csv. The
schema is **read from the file's header**, not hardcoded — ``mechababs
configure`` chooses the pipelines per campaign (writing the header via
``initial_header``), so the accessor discovers them from the columns present.

The ledger is a re-derivable cache; mutators hold the campaign-level flock
(``utils.locked``) so there is a single writer.
