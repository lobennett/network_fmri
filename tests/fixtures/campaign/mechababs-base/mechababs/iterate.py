"""iterate.py — the campaign reconciler tick.

One `iterate` advances each (dataset, pipeline) cell by AT MOST ONE transition,
routing on which ledger columns are filled:
  - `_babs` empty            -> SCAFFOLD: generate the inclusion into the campaign
                                pin (or reuse it; a chained cell skips it), compose
                                the babs config, `babs init` (NO submit), record
                                `_babs` (the project-root path).
  - `_babs` set, not merged  -> ACTIVE: read `babs status --json`, take the next
                                step (deploy more / skip / merge / flag-failed).
  - `_babs-merged` set       -> done, skipped (no babs query).

The ACTIVE step is decided from `babs status --json` counts (the babs_status
decide seam) and dispatched through ITERATE_ACTIONS. mechababs shells out to babs /
merge_config.py and imports the select and babs_status modules. `--dry-run` runs
read-only steps (e.g. `babs status`) for real and prints the mutating commands
without running them.
